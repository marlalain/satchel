# How to setup

This can take a while.

```sh
git clone https://www.github.com/paulo-e/satchel.git
cd satchel
npm install
cd client
npm install
mkdir public/musics public/pictures public/documents public/videos
cd ..
npm run dev
```

If you don't want some type of upload like Videos for example, just don't create the folder "client/client/public/videos"
